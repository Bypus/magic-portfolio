## Automated Test Bench Validation

This project focused on automating the validation of a **Keolabs** test bench used to control and validate **measurement instruments**, including oscilloscopes and proprietary internal tools.

The objective was to **reduce manual validation**, improve **test reliability**, and ensure consistent behavior across both the **API layer** and the **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

---

## Context & Approach

The work started with **manual validation testing**, which helped identify critical user workflows and edge cases.  
Close collaboration with the **R&D team** was essential to understand system behavior and design meaningful automated tests.

The validation process covered both **software and hardware aspects**, ensuring the test bench operated reliably in real industrial conditions.  
As the test bench and its tools evolved, validation strategies and test cases were continuously updated to stay aligned with new features and API changes.

## Responsibilities

### API Validation
- Designed and implemented **automated unit tests** for the instrument control API  
- Validated command execution, data consistency, and error handling  
- Maintained test reliability as the API evolved  

### GUI, Installation & System Testing
- Automated **GUI-based validation** of the test bench using **Ranorex**  
- Implemented **software installation and update tests**  
- Verified correct behavior of the test bench in operational environments  

### Hardware & Test Infrastructure
- Performed **hardware verification** of measurement instruments and connected devices  
- Installed and configured **test servers** used for automated validation  
- Ensured correct interaction between hardware, software, and test environments  

### Test Environments, CI & Production Support
- Built **virtualized environments with VirtualBox**  
- Simulated multiple configurations and usage scenarios  
- Integrated API and GUI tests into a **Jenkins CI pipeline**  
- Provided **active support to the production team** by analyzing failures and improving test robustness
