## Overview

Development of a self-hosted banking app to keep track of your expenses using Vite and React for front-end and sqlite as a database.

## Key Features

- **Reusable UI kit**: Built modular cards, lists, forms, and filters with React + Tailwind, keeping everything responsive and keyboard-accessible.
- **Theming & tokens**:  Centralized dark palette, spacing, and typography via Tailwind config and shared CSS variables for quick tweaks and consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **React + Vite + TypeScript**: Fast DX for the SPA frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom theme tokens.
- **Figma**: Source of truth for UI assets and tokens.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing flexibility (custom filters, category sets, blur-toggle privacy control) with consistency required clear tokens and guardrails. Aligning Figma tokens with Tailwind theme and documenting edge states reduced regressions and sped up UI changes.

## Outcome

A cohesive banking dashboard UI: faster iteration on filters/forms, consistent dark styling across stats and transaction lists, fewer visual mismatches between design and code, and smoother collaboration between design and engineering.
