## DevOps Engineer – Software Team

As part of the **Software team at Keolabs**, I worked as a **DevOps engineer** focusing on the automation, quality, and reliability of internal software and test suites.

My role was centered on improving **deployment workflows**, **test automation**, and **code quality**, while working closely with developers through **pair programming** practices.

---

## Context & Approach

The work was carried out within the **software development team**, in a collaborative environment where automation and reliability were key to supporting ongoing product development.

Pair programming was used regularly to share knowledge, align on best practices, and ensure consistent implementation of DevOps and testing strategies.

## Responsibilities

### Test Automation & Deployment
- Developed **Python unit tests** to validate internal software and automated test suites  
- Used **Ansible** to automate testing and deployment workflows  
- Ensured **regular and reliable deployments**, including **version management with Git (GitLab)** for internal tools and test suites  

### DevOps Practices
- Worked in **pair programming** with software developers to design and improve automation pipelines  
- Helped standardize deployment and testing processes across the team  

### Code Quality & CI
- Analyzed and monitored **code quality with SonarQube**  
- Integrated testing, deployment, and quality checks into **Jenkins pipelines**  
- Improved early detection of regressions and code issues
